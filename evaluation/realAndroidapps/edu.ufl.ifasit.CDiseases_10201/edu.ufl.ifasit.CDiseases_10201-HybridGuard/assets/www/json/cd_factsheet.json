Mottling is most frequently found on   newly mature hardened-off leaves but fades with leaf age.  The blotchy   mottle will be visible on both sides of the leaf and have multiple hues of   yellow and green.  Dark green areas can sometimes be reduced to small   circular dark green dots that contrast with the light yellow/green   background.  This symptom is referred to as green islands and had been   occasionally observed on sweet orange. In addition to blotchy mottle, infected   leaves may be thicker and leathery and have raised corky veins.  It is   common to observe foliar symptoms that resemble nutrient deficiency similar to   zinc patterned deficiency.  A tree affected by HLB may exhibit yellow   shoots and or deficiency symptoms that are on one or many branches   randomly arranged in the canopy.  This contrasts with a true nutrition   deficiency that is exhibited uniformly throughout the canopy.  On severely   infected branches leaves may form \"rabbit ears\" that are small upright shoots   with compressed internodes.</p>  <p>Fruit - fruit may be small and lopsided.  Cut fruit may have a   curved axis and the vascular columella can be stained orange-brown.  Seed   abortion is also common.

Where <em>T.   citricida</em> does occur, <em>Aphis gossypii</em> (Glover), the cotton/melon   aphid, is the primary vector. The aphid can acquire the virus after feeding   on infected plants for 5-60 minutes; but loses the ability to transmit the   virus after 24 hours. CTV is also graft-transmitted, but not transmitted through   seed. The virus exists in many forms known as strains that vary in the type   and severity of symptoms manifested in host plants. Some strains are mild   and produce no noticeable symptoms however; other strains are severe causing   decline and death of the tree or deep pits in the trunk and stem. CTV is   phloem-limited and the largest of the known plant viruses.    </p>  ", 
        "3": "          <p>There are three distinct syndromes of CTV infection: quick decline, stem   pitting, and seedling yellows. The most notorious is quick decline (QD) and   is associated with the name Tristeza. It is a three-component malady   consisting of a sweet orange variety used as a scion grafted onto sour orange   rootstock and infected with a quick decline strain of CTV. In this case,   the virus affects the cambium layer right below the bud union and prevents the   normal development of cambium cells (that mature into xylem and phloem   cells). As a result, the flow of photosynthetic products from the upper   portions of the tree down to the roots and water and nutrients adsorbed by the   roots and transported up the tree are blocked. The decline may not occur   for several years, or it may occur rapidly after a heat and/or water stress   event, leaving fruit shriveled on the tree and leaves brown and   dehydrated. When the decline is slow, often a bulge occurs above the bud   union when a window is cut in the bark (inner flap).</p>  <p>Severe strains of CTV cause symptoms such as stem pitting (SP) and seedling   yellows (SY), regardless of the rootstock. Grapefruit varieties are most   susceptible to stem pitting strains, but these strains can be severe for many   other citrus varieties. When the bark is peeled away, pits in the wood can   be observed ranging from short and narrow to elongated and deep; gum is   sometimes associated with the pits. Trunks may be so severely impacted that they   have a ropey appearance. Severely affected trees are chlorotic, stunted,   and generally have a low yield of poor quality fruit. <em>Citrus   macrophylla</em> or alemow is most susceptible to SP strains.</p>  <p>Seedling yellows (SY) is typically not seen in field situations with the   exception of topworking SY-infected trees with grapefruit or lemon   budwood. It affects primarily young seedlings, and nursery workers rogue   out affected plants. The SY reaction is frequently used to describe field   collected isolates of the virus in bio-characterization experiments performed   under controlled greenhouse conditions. A severe strain often causes the SY   symptom in sour orange, grapefruit and lemon host indicator plants.</p>  <p>Leaf - chlorotic leaf flecking, vein clearing, leaf cupping, corking of   leaf veins, and stem pitting.</p>  <p>Fruit - reduced fruit size.</p>  <p>Whole tree- the symptoms are similar to root injury. These symptoms   include thinning of foliage, twig dieback, retardation of growth and possibly   tree collapse. </p>  <p>Trunk - inside of the bark a honeycomb or stem pitting appearance can be   detected with the unaided eye.
